# FinalProject

Okay well my local git references got corrupted somehow and I had to go through and edit the files through github directly to update my work so hopefully everything is correct.

The "main1" ID: I have an id called "main1" which I have been using to grab and replace web content when the tabs and other buttons are pushed. It should replace everything under the hero.

Home: When the page loads you will see a hero header for Chapel Hill Restaurants and Bars. There will be four buttons in the footer of the hero that correspond to Home, Restaurants, Bars, and About. You will automatically be on the home tab, which displays a sign up form and a login form for the user to fill out. The sign up form is a work in progress (semi-functional) and the login form has not been touched.

Restaurants: This tab will change the content below the hero to be a list of images of different restaurants in Chapel Hill. The images will be clickable (click on the TOPO image to see what an individual page for a restaurant will look like). I don't know if we should have the user be able to add restaurants or not.

Bars: Same thing as Restaurants, but with bars.

About: I just wanted a fourth tab so it's a simple about page.
