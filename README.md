# FinalProject

Okay well my local git got corrupted somehow and I think I went through and edited the files through github directly to update my work so hopefully everything is correct.

You can see what I have formatted for the individual restaurant/bar by going to the restaurants tab and clicking on the TOPO image.

The sign-up form is supposed to work. The email part is being wonky as the form will work if you don't put an email but fail if you do which makes no sense whatsoever. This is what I was working on before git decided to be a piece of shit, so it might not be functional if you git pull (I think I got everything copied over though).

The sign-up button isn't working as it should and I don't know why. It doesn't replace the form with text if successful. No idea why. Tired of this.
